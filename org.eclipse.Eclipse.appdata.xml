	<description>
		<p>
			The Eclipse Platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet nothing
			in particular. It provides a foundation for constructing and running integrated
			software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool builders to independently
			develop tools that integrate with other people's tools so seamlessly you can't tell
			where one tool ends and another starts.
		</p>
		<p>
			This package provides the whole Eclipse SDK that contains Eclipse Platform, Java
			development tools and Plug-in Development Environment, including source and both
			user and programmer documentation.
